## OpenRecipeBook Collaborative Cooking

OpenRecipeBook is a recipe book written for the modern kitchen! One of the best things about open source is its collaborative nature and the sense of community that it creates. For a lot of projects however, finding new contributors can be difficult since many users donâ€™t have the inclination to code, and writing high quality documentation can be very difficult. This project hopes to occupy a niche where contributing documentation through open source can be fun and easy, because anybody can cook and recipes can be fun to share!
